DESCRIPTION					     *EditSimilar-description*

Files edited in Vim often relate to one another; maybe they just differ in
file extensions, are numbered sequentially, or contain common patterns. One
can use the built-in |cmdline-completion|  or |filename-modifiers| like %:r to
quickly edit a similar file, or even use special plugins, e.g. to alternate
between source and header files (vimscript #31).

This plugin provides custom versions of
the|:edit|,|:view|,|:split|,|:vsplit|,|:sview|,|:file|,|:write| and|:saveas|
commands which facilitate quick and simple editing of similarly named files.
To quickly edit another file based on the current file, one can:
- substitute {old} with {new}			   |EditSimilar-substitutions|
- go to previous/next numbered file or			  |EditSimilar-offset|
  add any offset to the number
- go to succeeding / preceding files in the same directory  |EditSimilar-next|
- change the file extension				    |EditSimilar-root|

To open a set of similar files, it is possible to:
- open all files matching a pattern in split windows	 |EditSimilar-pattern|

==============================================================================
USAGE							   *EditSimilar-usage*
						   *EditSimilar-substitutions*
Substitutions: Change all occurrences via {text}={replacement} in the
currently edited file (modeled after the Korn shell's "cd {old} {new}"
command). This can also be achieved with the built-in |filename-modifiers|: >
    :edit %:gs?pattern?replacement?
but the syntax is difficult to memorize (it's subtly different from |:s|) and
harder to type (because one has to use regular expressions instead of the
simpler file wildcards).

							     *:EditSubstitute*
:EditSubstitute[!] {text}={replacement} [{text}={replacement} [...]]
							     *:ViewSubstitute*
:ViewSubstitute[!] {text}={replacement} [{text}={replacement} [...]]
							     *SplitSubstitute*
:SplitSubstitute[!] {text}={replacement} [{text}={replacement} [...]]
							   *:VSplitSubstitute*
:VSplitSubstitute[!] {text}={replacement} [{text}={replacement} [...]]
							     *SViewSubstitute*
:SViewSubstitute[!] {text}={replacement} [{text}={replacement} [...]]
			Replaces all literal occurrences of {text} in the
			currently edited file with {replacement}, and opens the
			resulting file. If all substitutions can be made on the
			filename, the pathspec is left alone (so you don't get
			any false replacements on a long pathspec). Otherwise,
			the substitutions that weren't applicable to the
			filename are done to the full absolute pathspec.
			Finally, substitutions spanning both pathspec and
			filename are made.

			By taking advantage of these substitution scopes, you
			can substitute occurrences in both path and filename
			by specifying the same substitution twice: >
			    /etc/test/superapp/test001.cfg
			    :EditSubstitute test=prod
			    /etc/test/superapp/prod001.cfg
			    :EditSubstitute test=prod test=prod
			    /etc/prod/superapp/prod001.cfg
<			Or perform different substitutions on filename and
			pathspec: >
			    /etc/test/superapp/test001.cfg
			    :EditSubstitute test=prod test=production
			    /etc/production/superapp/prod001.cfg
<			Or across the entire filespec: >
			    /etc/test/superapp/test001.cfg
			    :EditSubstitute superapp/test=normalapp/prod
			    /etc/test/normalapp/prod001.cfg

<			Both {text} and {replacement} can include the usual
			file wildcards (?, *, ** and [...], cp. |file-pattern|)
			to save typing; however, the file-pattern must resolve
			to exactly one filespec, as the underlying ex commands
			can only open a single file. >
			    /etc/test/superapp/test001.cfg
			    :EditSubstitute test=p* test=p*
			    /etc/production/superapp/prod001.cfg
			    :EditSubstitute **=/tmp [01]=X
			    /tmp/prodXXX.cfg
<			Add [!] to create a new file when the substituted file
			does not exist.
							     *:FileSubstitute*
:FileSubstitute {text}={replacement} [{text}={replacement} [...]]
							    *:WriteSubstitute*
:WriteSubstitute[!] {text}={replacement} [{text}={replacement} [...]]
							     *:SaveSubstitute*
:SaveSubstitute[!] {text}={replacement} [{text}={replacement} [...]]
			Replaces all occurrences of {text} in the currently
			edited file with {replacement}, and sets / writes the
			resulting file. Wildcards can be used here, too.
			The [!] is needed to overwrite an existing file.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							  *EditSimilar-offset*
Plus / Minus: Add an offset to the last (decimal) number in the currently
edited file.
						      *:EditPlus* *:EditMinus*
:[N]EditPlus[!] [N]
:[N]EditMinus[!] [N]
						      *:ViewPlus* *:ViewMinus*
:[N]ViewPlus[!] [N]
:[N]ViewMinus[!] [N]
						    *:SplitPlus* *:SplitMinus*
:[N]SplitPlus[!] [N]
:[N]SplitMinus[!] [N]
						  *:VSplitPlus* *:VSplitMinus*
:[N]VSplitPlus[!] [N]
:[N]VSplitMinus[!] [N]
						    *:SViewPlus* *:SViewMinus*
:[N]SViewPlus[!] [N]
:[N]SViewMinus[!] [N]
			Increases / decreases the last number found inside the
			full absolute filespec of the currently edited file by
			[N]. This works best on fixed-width numbers which are
			padded with leading zeros: 001, 011, 123, etc.
			If a file with that number does not exist, the
			substitution is retried with larger (no [N]) or
			smaller ([N] given) offsets, unless [!] is specified.
			This way, you can easily skip to the last / first
			numbered file by specifying a sufficiently large [N],
			(e.g. :99EditPlus), while zooming over gaps in the
			numbering via a simple :EditPlus.
			With [!], no skipping over non-existing numbers takes
			place; instead, a new file is created when the
			substituted file does not exist.
			When jumping to previous numbers, the resulting number
			will never be negative. A jump with [!] and [N] > 1 will
			create a file with number 1, not 0, but you can still
			create number 0 by repeating the command with [N] = 1.
			Examples: >
			test007.txt in a directory also containing 003-013.
			:EditPlus      -> test008.txt
			:99EditPlus    -> test013.txt
			:99EditPlus!   -> test106.txt [New File]
			:99Eprev       -> test003.txt
			:99Eprev!      -> test001.txt [New File]
			:EditPlus      -> test003.txt
<
						   *:FileMinus* *:FilePlus*
:[N]FilePlus [N]
:[N]FileMinus [N]
						 *:WriteMinus* *:WritePlus*
:[N]WritePlus[!] [N]
:[N]WriteMinus[!] [N]
						   *:SaveMinus* *:SavePlus*
:[N]SavePlus[!] [N]
:[N]SaveMinus[!] [N]
			Increases / decreases the last number found inside the
			full absolute filespec of the currently edited file by
			[N] and sets / writes that file. (A fixed number width
			via padding with leading zeros is maintained.)
			The [!] is needed to overwrite an existing file.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							    *EditSimilar-next*
Next / Previous: In the directory listing of the current file, go to
succeeding / preceding file entries.
						   *:EditNext* *:EditPrevious*
:[N]EditNext [{filelist}]
:[N]EditPrevious [{filelist}]
						   *:ViewNext* *:ViewPrevious*
:[N]ViewNext [{filelist}]
:[N]ViewPrevious [{filelist}]
						 *:SplitNext* *:SplitPrevious*
:[N]SplitNext [{filelist}]
:[N]SplitPrevious [{filelist}]
					       *:VSplitNext* *:VSplitPrevious*
:[N]VSplitNext [{filelist}]
:[N]VSplitPrevious [{filelist}]
						 *:SViewNext* *:SViewPrevious*
:[N]SViewNext [{filelist}]
:[N]SViewPrevious [{filelist}]
			From the files in the same directory as the current
			file, go to a succeeding / preceding one. If
			{filelist} is specified (typically not via separate
			files, but a file glob like foo*.txt), only those
			files matching the glob are considered. Otherwise, *
			is used, i.e. all files not starting with "." are
			considered. To consider really all files, pass .* *
			The 'wildignore' setting applies; matching files are
			ignored, as well as any subdirectories.
			The order of files is determined by the order in
			{filelist} and the operating system / file system's
			resolution of the glob, as elsewhere in Vim.
			The current buffer must be contained in {filelist} for
			the commands to work.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							    *EditSimilar-root*
Root: Change the file extension in the currently edited file.
This is an enhanced version of the built-in: >
    :edit %:r.{extension}
<								   *:EditRoot*
:EditRoot[!] {extension}
								   *:ViewRoot*
:ViewRoot[!] {extension}
								  *:SplitRoot*
:SplitRoot[!] {extension}
								 *:VSplitRoot*
:VSplitRoot[!] {extension}
								  *:SViewRoot*
:SViewRoot[!] {extension}
			Switches the current file's extension:
			Edits a file with the current file's path and name, but
			replaces the file extension with the passed one. The
			leading '.' in {extension} is optional; use either
			.txt or txt. To replace (or remove) multiple
			extensions, prepend a . for each one: >
			    myfile.txt.bak
			    :EditRoot ..cpp
			    myfile.cpp
			    :EditRoot .
			    myfile
<
			The {extension} can include the usual file wildcards
			(?, *, cp. |file-pattern|) to save typing; however, the
			file-pattern must resolve to exactly one existing
			file, as the underlying ex commands can only open one
			single file.

			Add [!] to create a new file when the substituted file
			does not exist.

								   *:FileRoot*
:FileRoot {extension}
								  *:WriteRoot*
:WriteRoot[!] {extension}
								   *:SaveRoot*
:SaveRoot[!] {extension}
			Sets / saves a file with the current file's path and
			name, but replaces the file extension with the passed
			one.
			The [!] is needed to overwrite an existing file.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							 *EditSimilar-pattern*
Pattern: Open all files matching the pattern in split windows, similar to how
|:argadd|{name} adds all matching files to the argument list.

							       *:SplitPattern*
:SplitPattern [++opt] [+cmd] {file-pattern} [{file-pattern} ...]
							      *:VSplitPattern*
:VSplitPattern [++opt] [+cmd] {file-pattern} [{file-pattern} ...]
							       *:SViewPattern*
:SViewPattern [++opt] [+cmd] {file-pattern} [{file-pattern} ...]
			Open all files matching {file-pattern} in split windows.
			If one of the files is already open, no second split is
			generated.
			The {file-pattern} can include the usual file wildcards
			(?, *, cp. |file-pattern|).
			Makes all windows the same size if more than one has
			been opened.

INSTALLATION					    *EditSimilar-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim EditSimilar*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					    *EditSimilar-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Optional, recommended: cmdalias plugin (vimscript #746).

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					   *EditSimilar-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

							 *EditSimilar-aliases*
All these edit commands are about speed; after all, they vie to be a faster
alternative to the built-in commands that take a complete filename. Each
user's Vim setup and behavior is different. Therefore, the previously defined
short command forms :Esubst, :Enext, etc. are gone in version 1.20. Instead,
you are encouraged to define your own shortcuts, depending on your preferences
and needs. A great way to do this (because it allows the definition of pure
lowercase commands) is defining short aliases through the cmdalias plugin
(vimscript #746), like this: >
    " Shorten the most frequently used commands from EditSimilar.vim.
    Alias es  EditSubstitute
    Alias sps SplitSubstitute
    Alias epl EditPlus
    Alias emi EditMinus
    Alias en  EditNext
    Alias ep  EditPrevious
    Alias er  EditRoot
    Alias spr SplitRoot
    Alias spp SplitPattern
<
			  *g:EditSimilar_splitmode* *g:EditSimilar_vsplitmode*
All :Split..., :VSplit... and :SView commands obey the default 'splitbelow'
and 'splitright' settings. If you want different behavior, you can insert the
appropriate split modifier command via: >
    let g:EditSimilar_splitmode = 'rightbelow'
    let g:EditSimilar_vsplitmode = 'rightbelow'
<

KNOWN PROBLEMS					  *EditSimilar-known-problems*

TODO							    *EditSimilar-todo*

IDEAS							    *EditSimilar-ideas*

- Add :EditRecursiveNext / :EditRecursivePrevious to recurse into and out of
  subdirectories.

==============================================================================
HISTORY							 *EditSimilar-history*

2.20	26-Aug-2012
- Allow passing of multiple {file-pattern} to :SplitPattern et al. and enable
  file completion for them.
- Handle optional ++opt +cmd file options and commands in :SplitPattern et al.

2.10	26-Jul-2012
ENH: Complete file extensions for any files found in the file's directory for
those commands that most of the time are used to create new files; the default
search for the current filename's extensions won't yield anything there.

2.01	12-Jun-2012
FIX: To avoid issues with differing forward slash / backslash path separator
components, canonicalize the glob pattern and filespec. This avoids a "Cannot
locate current file" error when there is a mismatch.

2.00	11-Jun-2012
- Rename the :EditNext / :EditPrevious commands to :EditPlus / :EditMinus and
  redefine them to operate on directory contents instead of numerical offsets.
  *** PLEASE USE THE NEW RENAMED COMMANDS AND
      UPDATE ANY USAGES IN SCRIPTS AND MAPPINGS
  ***
- Better modularization of the different similarities.
- BUG: Substituted filenames that only exist in an unpersisted Vim buffer
  cause a "file does not exist" error when a:isCreateNew isn't set. Also check
  Vim buffers for a match.

1.22	10-Feb-2012
ENH: Allow [v]split mode different than determined by 'splitbelow' /
'splitright' via configuration.

1.21	19-Jan-2012 (unreleased)
Refactoring: Move file extension completion to EditSimilar#Root#Complete() and
create the root commands also in the command builder.

1.20	08-Nov-2011 (unreleased)
- ENH: Omit current buffer's file extension from the completion for
  EditSimilar-root commands.
- Obsolete the short command forms :Esubst, :Enext, :Eprev; the starting
  uppercase letter makes them still awkward to type, there's more likely a
  conflict with other custom commands (e.g. :En -> :Encode, :Enext), and I now
  believe aliasing via cmdalias.vim is the better way to provide personal
  shortcuts, instead of polluting the command namespace with all these
  duplicates.
- Rename :Vsplit... -> :VSplit... and :Sview... -> :SView... as I think this
  is a more intuitive long form. (And now that the user is encouraged to
  create his own custom short aliases, anyway.) The only other plugin with
  similar commands that I know is bufexplorer with its :VSBufExplorer.

1.19	25-Jul-2011
Avoid that :SplitPattern usually opens splits in reverse glob order (with
default 'nosplitbelow' / 'nosplitright') by forcing :belowright splitting for
all splits after the first. I.e. behave more like vim -o {pattern}.

1.18	22-Jun-2011
ENH: Implement completion of file extensions for EditSimilar-root commands
like :EditRoot.

1.17	25-Feb-2010
BUG: :999EditPrevious on 'file00' caused E121: Undefined variable:
l:replacement.

1.16	11-Nov-2009
BUG: Next / previous commands interpreted files such as 'C406' as hexadecimal.
Thanks to Andy Wokula for sending a patch.

1.15	09-Sep-2009
Offset commands (:EditNext et al.) now check that the digit pattern does not
accidentally match inside a hexadecimal number (which are unsupported).

1.14	21-Aug-2009
- BF: :[N]EditPrevious with supplied [N] would skip over existing smaller
  number file and would claim that no substituted file existed.
- BF: :[N]EditPrevious with supplied large [N] together with a low original
  number hogs the CPU because the loop iterates over the entire number range
  where the resulting offset would be negative.

1.13	27-Jun-2009
ENH: :EditNext / :EditPrevious without the optional [count] now skip over gaps
in numbering.

1.12	13-May-2009
- ENH: {text} in :EditSubstitute can now also contain file wildcards (?, *, **
  and [...]) to save typing.
- ENH: On Windows, {text} in :EditSubstitute can now also use forward slashes
  as path separators (as an alternative to the usual backslashes).
- ENH: Supporting substitutions spanning both pathspec and filename by finally
  applying failed replacements of multi-path elements to the entire filespec.

1.11	11-May-2009
Added ":ViewSimilar" and ":SviewSimilar" commands to open similar files in
read-only mode.

1.10	23-Feb-2009
ENH: {replacement} in :EditSubstitute and {extension} in :EditRoot can now
contain file wildcards to save typing.

1.00	18-Feb-2009
First published version.

0.01	29-Jan-2009
Started development.
